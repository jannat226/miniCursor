 Mini Cursor: The Tiny Tool-Using AI Agent
A command-line AI assistant that doesnâ€™t just talk the talk â€” it runs commands, fetches weather, and executes like a boss.


ðŸš€ What is this?
Mini Cursor is a minimalist AI assistant framework powered by GPT-4o. It follows a smart, tool-based execution loop â€” planning, acting, and observing â€” all while staying within the lines of JSON-based logic. Think of it as a lightweight agent that actually does stuff, not just chats about doing it.

ðŸ§  How It Works
This little beast thinks in four steps:

Plan: Figures out what needs to happen.

Action: Picks the right tool for the job.

Observe: Waits and sees what happened.

Output: Reports back with conclusions.

Each step is strictly defined in JSON, making it deterministic, inspectable, and ready for extension.
